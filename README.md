# Scraping Accepted Paper Lists from CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, AAAI, ACL, etc.

This project provides a web scraper for extracting historical accepted paper lists from the Paper Copilot website and supports bulk downloading from arXiv.
For example, the CVPR 2022 dataset can be scraped. The collected accepted paper lists can be used for statistical analysis, trend prediction, paper recommendation, and author collaboration network construction.
